# TICTACTOE

Start the server from your IDE

Open up two terminals for two different clients.
CD into the src file in both the terminals
javac T8Client.java (compile)
java T8Client (run the client) from both the terminals.

You can see two GUI will pop up. The game will not start until both the players enter their names. The first client is assigned player1
and second client is player2. This version does not support connection from multiple clients.

You can also track each action from each client from the corresponding terminal in text form.
